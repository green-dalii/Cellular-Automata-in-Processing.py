# Cellular-Automata-in-Processing.py

A project contains few of processing.py codes about Cellular-Automata:

- **Code Of Life:**
  The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
  
  The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties. ,([Wikipedia-Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life))

- **Color Eat in Cycles:** the cellulars in this programmer are divided to three colors:red,green,blue.The rule is the red eats the green,the green eats the blue,the blue eats red.
